# Let-s-Detect

##Abstract

Vision is one of the most beautiful senses humans possess. Vision is the ability to see.
We have two eyes, each with a lens and an iris which focuses light onto the retina at the back
of our eye. The retina converts this light into electrical signals that are sent along nerves to our
brain where they are interpreted as images. Humans, as travellers, work people, etc. come across
various scenarios but every time they can't be recognized by the human brain.
“Let’s Detect” is the YOLOv5-powered AI-based android mobile application that
captures the image, recognizes the objects in the image, and generates a detailed report of the
detected objects. Let’s Detect can detect up to 83 categories which are present in the COCO dataset
and draw the anchor boxes around them. Let’s Detect uses cameraX for low latency image
processing.
The output is a detailed reports including the image with bounding boxes enclosing the
objects, coordinates of the objects with respect to the image, and all necessary information
about the objects.
